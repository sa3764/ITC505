            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my essay. This section introduces the main topic and explains the background behind my discussion. 
                Clear structure and readability are crucial in any web-based document, so this version has been carefully formatted for visual appeal and accessibility.

            <h2>Main Content</h2>
            <p>
                The main section of the essay contains several paragraphs that discuss ideas, examples, and reasoning. 
                Good design enhances comprehension — color, spacing, and typography help readers engage with content instead of being distracted by clutter.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this design, headings are clearly distinguished, the text is comfortably sized, and generous white space allows the eyes to rest.
                The colors were chosen to maintain contrast and professionalism while providing a warm and approachable tone.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, aesthetics and readability go hand in hand in effective design. This essay demonstrates how proper CSS styling 
                can transform a plain page into a polished presentation while maintaining semantic integrity and accessibility.

            <h2>Addendum: Stylistic Choices</h2>

            <h3>Font Choices</h3>
            <p>
                I used <strong>Georgia</strong> for headings because it conveys a formal, academic tone. 
                The body text uses <strong>Arial</strong>, a modern sans-serif font that is easy to read on screens.
            </p>

            <h3>Heading and Text Sizes</h3>
            <p>
                The title (<code>h1</code>) is 40px for prominence. Section headings (<code>h2</code>) are 28px, and subheadings (<code>h3</code>) are 22px. 
                The paragraph text is set to 18px for comfortable reading distance and flow.
            </p>

            <h3>Color Choices</h3>
            <p>
                I chose a <strong>pink and navy palette</strong> for a soft yet elegant appearance. The background is light pink for warmth, and text uses darker shades for contrast.
            </p>

            <h3>Margins and Padding</h3>
            <p>
                The document includes generous padding (25–40px) to maintain white space and focus attention on content.
                Each section has soft borders and shadows to define structure and improve readability.
            </p>

            <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
            <p>
                In Lab 2, I used an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for the main title purely for visual reasons. 
                This has now been corrected to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to preserve semantic structure. 
                All visual adjustments are now handled with CSS, not HTML.
